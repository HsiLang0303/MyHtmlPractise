references from HTML 4.\n\n## Contents\n\n*   [What is this?](#what-is-this)\n*   [When should I use this?](#when-should-i-use-this)\n*   [Install](#install)\n*   [Use](#use)\n*   [API](#api)\n    *

[License](#license)\n\n## What is this?\n\nThis is a map of named character references in HTML 4 to the characters they\nrepresent.\n\n## When should I use this?\n\nMaybe when you’re writing an HTML parser or minifier, but otherwise probably\nnever!\nEven then, it might be better to use [`parse-entities`][parse-entities] or\n[`stringify-entities`][stringify-entities].\n\n## Install\n\nThis package is [ESM only][esm].\nIn Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:\n\n```sh\nnpm install character-entities-html4\n```\n\nIn Deno with [Skypack][]:\n\n```js\nimport {characterEntitiesHtml4} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/character-entities-html4@2?dts'\n```\n\nIn browsers with [Skypack][]:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import {characterEntitiesHtml4} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/character-entities-html4@2?min'\n</script>\n```\n\n## Use\n\n```js\nimport {characterEntitiesHtml4} from 'character-entities-html4'\n\nconsole.log(characterEntitiesHtml4.AElig) // => 'Æ'\nconsole.log(characterEntitiesHtml4.aelig) // => 'æ'\nconsole.log(characterEntitiesHtml4.amp) // => '&'\nconsole.log(characterEntitiesHtml4.apos) // => undefined\n```\n\n## API\n\nThis package exports the following identifiers: `characterEntitiesHtml4`.\nThere is no default export.\n\n### `characterEntitiesHtml4`\n\nMap of case sensitive named character references from HTML 4.\nSee [`w3.org`][html] for more info.\n\n## Types\n\nThis package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis package is at least compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js.\nAs of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.\nIt also works in Deno and modern browsers.\n\n## Security\n\nThis package is safe.\n\n## Related\n\n*   [`parse-entities`](https://github.com/wooorm/parse-entities)\n    — parse (decode) character references\n*
